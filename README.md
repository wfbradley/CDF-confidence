CDF-confidence
==============

These were a set of Python tools to plot CDFs with confidence intervals written in 2014. Since then, the code has been rewritten and improved.  The new code has migrated to the "Mirabolic" repo, and can be installed with
```
pip install mirabolic
```
The repo can be examined at
```
https://github.com/Mirabolic/mirabolic
```

Because the new code is strictly better, I am removing the scripts here and leaving only this message.  If you need to access the original files, you can recover a snapshot of them by git-pulling the repo and then running 
```
git checkout v0.0.1
```
