CDF-confidence
==============

These were a set of Python tools to plot CDFs with confidence intervals written in 2014. The code has since been substantially improved and has migrated to the "Mirabolic" module.  The improved tools can be installed with
```
pip install mirabolic
```
or the code can be examined at
```
https://github.com/Mirabolic/mirabolic
```

Because the new code strictly better, I am removing the scripts here and leaving only this message.  If you need to access the original files, you can recover a snapshot of them by git-pulling the repo and then running 
```
git checkout v0.0.1
```
